# About
This program uses [nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) to plot an NBA or WNBA player's statistical averages for any season.

It generates a bar graph with points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks using Plotly, and saves it as an HTML file named `stat_bar.html`.

## Instructions

1. Install all required packages:
<pre>pip install -r requirements.txt</pre>

1. In folder NBA-Stats/code, run:
<pre>python main.py</pre>

3. Then, follow the instructions in the terminal.
